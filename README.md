## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

This was an easy challenge. I first completed this challenge a year ago but I decided to update all of my challenges.
I also did a clean rewrite, I completely ditched the old project.
I avoided the media queries for the desktop/tablet versions by using grid. I could've used media queries ofc but this is cleaner. 2 row version for tablets was also intended and I like it.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vite.js
